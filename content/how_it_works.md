I would really like to help you get on top of the clutter in your house once and for all and to have everything be organised. The best way to do this is to go through categories of items all at once (all books, all clothes, all kitchen items, etc.) or to go through one room/area at a time. I’ve done both approaches and it really depends on the individual and their specific needs. Whichever way we approach this process, it’s best to start with non-sentimental items. As we go along, we will also look at how each room/area is laid out and see if furniture can be rearranged to improve the flow and overall aesthetics. We will also look at lighting as well. We will see what we can reuse from your home, and then budget permitting, fill in the gaps. It’s like decluttering, organising and interior design all rolled into one with the end result being a wonderhouse where you can find everything and it all looks fantastic. This process is really game changing and you will learn the tools of upkeep along the way that you can then pass along to other family members.

### Process

- **Initial 90 minute consultation**: We will walk together through your house identifying all key areas to come up with a streamlined plan of attack/approach. I can answer any questions you have on how it all works and give you some tips and practical advice on how to get started. We will also begin work on a small section so you can see this plan/approach in action.

- **Weekly or twice monthly in-house 3-3.5 hour sessions**: In my experience, each house will need 6-8 sessions to get it into order (not including a garage). I will be there with you going through every item you own and offering support while you decide what to keep, what to donate and what to get rid of. I will not make any decisions for you, but I can offer helpful tips and coaching along the way. We will also talk about furniture and lighting placement, plus organisational strategies (including what containers/shelving solutions, etc. to use) as well during this time. In between each session, you will also have an additional de-cluttering assignment.

- **Ideally we will meet once a week**: Momentum will build on itself during this process and it’s best not to leave more than 2 weeks between each session. The last session can also be used to address any additional organisational needs that have arisen.

- **Once your house is in order**: We can meet on an hourly or project basis for additional interior design services that are needed. Now that you have a house that is organised and only contains the items you love, your own personal style will really stand out. It will quickly become apparent if there are areas that still need a bit of help to work efficiently, shine and reflect your personality.
